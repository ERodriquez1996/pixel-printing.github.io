        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the Pupusas:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups masa harina , white or yellow</li>
            <li>3 ½ - 4 cups warm water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons butter , softened (optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chicken bouillon paste (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the filling:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can refried beans , or homemade</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese , or Oaxaca cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Optional Toppings:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>salsa roja</li>
            <li>curtido</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Make Dough:</b>
                Add masa harina (corn flour) and salt to a large mixing bowl. 
                Add the warm water, little by little, mixing the dough with your
                hand. You may not need all of the water. You want the masa to 
                be the consistency of a soft play dough. If the dough is too 
                wet, mix in some more masa harina. If it's too dry, add a 
                little more water. Mix in butter and chicken bouillon, 
                if using.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Scoop into balls:</b>
                Scoop the dough into large, golf-ball-size portions. You can
                scoop all of the dough into balls before continuing, or 
                make 1 pupusa at a time. Be sure to keep the dough covered 
                with a damp cloth as you work, to keep it from drying out.
            </li>
                <b>Flatten and add filling:</b>
                Use the palms of your hands to pat the dough into a disc, about 
                4 inches in diameter. Scoop about half a tablespoon of the beans
                and place it in the center of the dough circle, followed by a 
                pinch of shredded cheese. 
            <li>
                <b>Shape into disc:</b>
                Gently bring the edges of the dough up and around the filling, 
                pinching it closed into a ball. Gently pat the dough between 
                your palms to form it into a disc again. Be gentle so you don’t 
                have big cracks of filling come through, but if you do have 
                some, its fine! They don't need to be perfect.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Cook:</b>
                Heat a large un-greased skillet or pan over medium heat. Place 
                pupusas on the hot pan and cook for about 2-4 minutes on each 
                side. You will know the pupusas are ready to flip when the edges 
                are set and the bottom is lightly golden.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Serve</b>
                immediately, topped with Curtido and Salsa Roja.
            </li>
        <h2>Salsa Roja</h2>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 head cabbage , finely shredded</li>
            <li>1/2 red onion , very thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 carrots , finely shredded</li>
            <li>1 fresh jalapeño pepper , sliced (optional)</li>
            <li>hot boiling water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano leaves</li>
            <li>salt , to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white vinegar (or apple cider vinegar)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring 4 cups of water to a boil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place cabbage in a fine mesh strainer. Very slowly pour boiling 
                water over the cabbage. Rinse with cold water. Drain well, 
                pressing out as much water as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add cabbage to large bowl. Add carrot, onion, jalapeno, oregano,
                and vinegar and toss well to combine. I like to put it all in a 
                bowl with a lid and shake it
            </li>
            <li>
                Curtido tastes best after it has marinated for several hours or 
                days, but you can enjoy it fresh if you'd like.
            </li> 
            <li>
                Store curtido in a covered container or mason jar for up to 1 
                week in the fridge.
            </li>
