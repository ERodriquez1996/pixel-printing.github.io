            Graphic design is a profession,<sup>[2]</sup> 
            academic discipline<sup>[3][4][5]</sup> 
            and applied art whose activity consists in projecting visual 
            communications intended to transmit specific messages to social 
            groups, with specific objectives.<sup>[6]</sup> Graphic design is an 
            interdisciplinary branch of design<sup>[1]</sup> and of the fine arts. Its 
            practice involves creativity, innovation and lateral thinking using 
            manual or digital tools, where it is usual to use text and graphics 
            to communicate visually.

            The role of the graphic designer in the communication process is 
            that of encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the 
            interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages. 
            Usually, graphic design uses the aesthetics of typography and the 
            compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery to 
            convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what language alone 
            expresses. The design work can be based on a customer's demand, a 
            demand that ends up being established linguistically, either orally 
            or in writing, that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic 
            message into a graphic manifestation.<sup>[7]</sup>
